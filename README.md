# Dots!
## An Original Project: Dev.Icarus

Feel free to use it and change it how you like - Dots operates under MIT licence. Dots is a function that uses anime.js to move objects from one location to another. 

#### That sounds pointless.. doesn't anime.js already do that? 

It does! thats the point. This is a simple function designed with *designers* in mind. wrap the elements you want to move in a div, give dots the container class or id as well as the wrapped elements class, id or type, as well as x & y start and end points and dots moves them. You can also call on the type of movement you want to tell dots how move the elements. cubicX cubicY linearX linearY are the 4 basic forms. it also can take in color arguments and works on svgs ( z translations to come).
