Feel free to use it and change it how you like - Dots operates under MIT licence. 

Dots is a function that uses anime.js to move objects from one location to another. Basically the dots function acts as a simple wrapper to create anime.js functions for easy transitions between points. You can select elements to dynamically translate *to* and *from*.  -> **see a demo: https://quest.devicarus.com**
or just open the index file.
